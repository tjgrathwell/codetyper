roadmap of the future
================
implement something to scrape random appropriate code snippets from google code, perl's CPAN, python's package library, wherever people keep code basically
(this would probably eventually be server-side and clients would gather new data from my server somewhere, given how slow the scraping process would be)

implement an end condition, probably a timer that says type as much as you can in five minutes

implement scoring based off the 'difficulty' of a given code snippet mostly meaning how many gobbletygook @#$(*{} characters are in it and how long is it etc

implement high score table

allow choosing of a 'lesson plan' like only php, only long snippets, whatever

more consequence for failure, like typing over the rest of the line and having to backspace instead of having it just add to miss count

title screen

mode to do all library functions from docs with proper arguments [ex:]
mysql_real_escape_string  ($unescaped_string)
mysql_real_escape_string  ($unescaped_string  [, $link_identifier  ] )
with or without optional parameters?

decrease font for big messages

fix bug with a miss being triggered for endline

sample debugger session mode

more visual pizzazz and whatnot
