Code Typer: a pyglet typing game experiment by Travis Grathwell

I wrote this in 2008, so I consider some of the code a little embarassing (and that's after I cleaned a lot of it up!). But it works.

The rationale was that I suck at typing the various symbol keys that one so desperately needs to be an effective perl programmer ($%{}) and most existing typing programs don't test those, or only do so in isolation. This thing comes with some "real-world" examples to prime your hands to type code all day.

The only dependency it should have is pyglet.
